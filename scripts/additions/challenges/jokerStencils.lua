-- So it turns out that GitHub doesn't create directories in the repo if they are unpopulated, which makes sense, I guess.
-- So for now, this is a placeholder lua that does nothing until I get around to implementing my idea.

-- For future reference, I have some ideas for a few challenges we could add,
-- my intentions so far for challenges being:

-- - Start with eternal 5 Joker Stencils, all debuffed.
--   From Ante 2 onwards, beating a Boss Blind will remove
--   one of the Joker Stencil's debuffs.
--   No other alterations planned (i.e. standard deck w/o
--   alterations, other run settings, etc.).

-- - "Turn Towels to Steel By Holding Your Breath": Start
--   with an eternal Biggdeck (Perkeo) and eternal Steel
--   Joker, All Kings & Queens in deck are steel, deck is
--   otherwise normal.
--   Banned Jokers: Baron, Mime (Probably more that I can't
--   think of off the top of my head)
--   Other Bans: Chariot, Death, Cryptid (Maybe more that
--   I can't think of off the top of my head - I don't
--   intend on restricting ALL sources of new Steel cards,
--   but I would like to make it extremely difficult
--   and not without difficulty/paying a significant price
--   in order to do so.
--   Start with 1 less hand, 1 less discard and $2.

-- - "Only Cir": Just bans anything not edited or added by
--   this mod, including the deck - With the alterations at
--   the time of writing (22nd of Feb), deck should be half
--   the size and consist entirely of Queens of Clubs and
--   Spades. Revise if there were changes to the deck skin.
