		-- B3313 form-changing Joker
		-- Ornstein & Smough Joker pair that respectively become Super Ornstein & Super Smough when the other of the two is destroyed (not sold)
		-- Redacted '██████' Joker whose effects are not clear, highly unpredictable and inconsistent, heavily RNG-based but also extremely confusing
		-- Mac n' Cheese Joker; Every 2 Boss Blinds, if there's room, creates a Ketchup (Seltzer). Gains x0.1 mult every time a ketchup runs out.
		-- SM64 Water Diamond Joker, switches between two forms if a given hand is played, that changes every round or on trigger.
		-- "Cirno Dropped His Matcha Ice Cream" dithering between having this be a Rare and an Uncommon. Dithering between the effect of "Sell this Joker during a blind to draw 2x hand size to card", "In X rounds, sell this Joker to multiply your number of discards by 1.5" & "Sell this Joker during a blind to discard all held cards and draw a new hand (If deck is empty, refresh deck)."
		-- Bloodborne on PC Joker: No idea what this could do.
