		-- B3313 form-changing Joker
		-- Ornstein & Smough Joker pair that respectively become Super Ornstein & Super Smough when the other of the two is destroyed (not sold)
		-- Redacted '██████' Joker whose effects are not clear, highly unpredictable and inconsistent, heavily RNG-based but also extremely confusing
		-- Mac n' Cheese Joker; Every 2 Boss Blinds, if there's room, creates a Ketchup (Seltzer). Gains x0.1 mult every time a ketchup runs out.
		-- SM64 Water Diamond Joker, switches between two forms if a given hand is played, that changes every round or on trigger.
		-- "Cirno Dropped His Matcha Ice Cream" dithering between having this be a Rare and an Uncommon. Dithering between the effect of "Sell this Joker during a blind to draw 2x hand size to card", "In X rounds, sell this Joker to multiply your number of discards by 1.5" & "Sell this Joker during a blind to discard all held cards and draw a new hand (If deck is empty, refresh deck)."
		-- Bloodborne on PC Joker: No idea what this could do.
		-- "Help I'm Trapped In The Joker Factory" will have some different effects that get selected randomly on joker creation, all related to blinds, one off the top of my head is "This Joker gives +5 mult during The Memory (the boss blind) & also gains X0.05 mult whenever Cirno forgets something" and then it just randomly gains X0.05 mult based on random, unpredictable criteria.
