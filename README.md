# Cirno_TV And Friends
A Balatro mod themed around [Cirno_TV](https://www.twitch.tv/Cirno_TV/), with various references & memes.

**WARNING:** Cirno_TV & Friends isn't explicitly an NSFW-oriented mod, but it does contain a handful of overt, (hopefully) stream-safe mature references in relation to community inside jokes (most particularly those with varying degrees of sexual connotation). This mod is *NOT* intended for children. By default, these (especially overt) mature references are significantly toned-down/altered, with the intent of having reduced mature references (in both number and intensity) encounterable in gameplay for anyone who wants to experience the mod, but is not particularly as interested in the some of the more mature references (and/or wants to stream it, but does not want to have that kind of stuff on their stream) - These changes can be adjusted in the mod's config settings, via the Mature References setting (In-game config setting changes require a game restart to take effect).

**Cirno_TV & Friends** is a collaborative effort between [DaemonTsun](https://bsky.app/profile/daemontsun.bsky.social) & [NοpeTooFast](https://bsky.app/profile/nopetoofast.bsky.expert), which retextures existing Jokers and adds some new ones, as well as various other changes such as some Joker names & descriptions, retextures of some enhancers & all blinds, and more!

DaemonTsun's art contributions are public domain - Some memes or pictures are not by him and copied as is, with some Jokers only being slightly edited. Further credits are available at the bottom of this README. Original Balatro art is property of LocalThunk.

## Installation
This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector), [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods) & [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk). Without these dependencies, this mod will not function.

**Installing Lovely & Steamodded:**
- [Refer to Steamodded's tutorial on installing both Lovely & Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki)

**Installing Malverk:**
- After following the previously linked tutorial, download the latest version of Malverk from its releases page (At time of writing, getting Malverk's "Source code" .zip *should* be fine (and is recommended) unless that page explicitly states something specific for you to download instead).
- Either by extracting the contents of or otherwise opening the Malverk .zip, you should get a folder of the same name as the zip file (or similar). Move that folder to the .../Balatro/mods directory you created in the previous tutorial.
- (To be safe) Ensure that Balatro runs properly. 

**Installing Cirno_TV & Friends:**
- Download the latest version of this mod from the releases page.
- Either by extracting the contents of or otherwise opening this mod's .zip, you should get a folder of the same name as the zip file (or similar). Move that folder to the .../Balatro/mods directory you created in the previous tutorial.

**First-Time Setup:**
*Changes may not immediately appear* as the majority of changes need to be enabled via Malkverk's textures menu, with other minor changes enabled in this mod's config menu.

To adjust config settings:
- With the game open and on the main menu, open the *'Mods'* menu, next to *'Collection'*.
- Locate and click on *'Cirno_TV & Friends'* in the list.
- Navigate to the *'Config'* tab.
- Adjust settings as desired.
- Restarting Balatro is required to apply changes. Steamodded adds a quick restart shortcut, which is Alt + F5.

To enable textures:
- With the game open, open the *Options* menu.
- Playing card textures can be enabled under *'Customize Deck'* and other textures can be enabled under *'Textures'*
- Via the cogwheel button on the texture pack card, you can optionally disable/enable texture groups in the texture pack settings.

**Updating this mod:**
- If this mod has since added any new dependencies since the last time you downloaded it (We probably won't? But generally it's safer to check than be confused why things broke later, and for whatever reason the possibility isn't zero), get those dependencies and ensure Balatro runs.
- Delete any previous version of this mod that exists in the .../Balatro/mods directory.
- Follow the steps outlined in **Installing this mod** again.
